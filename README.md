# EE381K_Convex_Optimization
course repo

This is a intro-level course to first-year graduate student on convex optimization taught by Prof. Aryan Mokhtari. It covers three parts in optimization:
1). thoery of linear programming (LP), quadratic programming (QP), quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), second-order cone programming (SOCP), and semidefinite programming (SDP). It also talked about the duality of LP and general optimization problems;

2). applications of convex optimization in engineering, operation research and statistics. The applications range from system and control theory, to estimation, to data fitting, to statistics, to machine learning.

3). optimiation algorithms. It covers gradient descent (GD),  exact (or backtracking) line search, and their convergence and complexity analysis; It also talked about Newton's Method and its convergence and complexity analysis.

It is a math-intense course and requires good familiarity in linear algebra. There is no coding involved but a lot of theory and proof.
